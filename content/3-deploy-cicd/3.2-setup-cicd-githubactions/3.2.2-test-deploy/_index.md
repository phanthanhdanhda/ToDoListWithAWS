## Push code and check the workflow

After creating the CI/CD workflow file, you can test it by pushing to GitHub.

4. Check the execution steps:
   - Connect to EC2
   - Pull code
   - Run npm install
   - Restart the application with PM2

---

### üåê Step 3: Access the application

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000
```

If everything is correct, you will see the To-do List web interface working properly after each code push.

You should check pm2 logs on EC2 if the application does not respond after deployment.
